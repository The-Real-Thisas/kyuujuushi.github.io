      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I'm alan generally around the internet, but here on github I'm known as kyuujuushi.
        I like to draw but I also like to code as well and I feel like if I intergrate code into my art it would make things waaaay interesting.
        I eventually want to work on game development and honestly I've been wanting to make one since 2016.
        However, I've been getting roadblocks constantly in all of my creative work mainly of school and the fact that
        C# isn't a language for beginners. I still have a grudge towards C# to this day and the only thing that would get rid of it
        would be a proper lesson instead of just looking at the C# docs for Unity.
      </p>
      <p>
        I honestly do not know what I want for my future besides creative work.
        I'm doing a bachelor right now for IT in the cyberforensics track since stuff like that is interesting,
        but I don't know if I would actually be working with a police department.
        I could also just be a web developer since its an easier framework to work with beside Unity.
        But I might just be, well, an artist.
